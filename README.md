# 2fa
The 2FA Authentification App is a two factor authentication taskbar app. 

## Compile
You need C++ and [Qt](https://www.qt.io) to compile this project.

## Tested
I tested it only on MacOS Sierra.

## Bugs
Sometimes the algorithm generates only 5 instead of 6 numbers. You need to wait for the next iteration to get a valid token.
